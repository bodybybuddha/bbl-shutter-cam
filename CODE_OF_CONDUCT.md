# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all. We respect and value every person who participates in our project, regardless of their level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or nationality.

## Expected Behavior

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- **Be respectful.** Value each other's ideas, styles and viewpoints even when you disagree. When we disagree, we do so constructively and professionally.
- **Be collaborative.** What we create is a complex whole made up of many parts; it's the sum of many efforts. Collaboration between teams that each have different responsibilities and different points of view is essential to our success. For the good of the product and the community, we will sometimes need to make decisions that go against the preferences of individuals.
- **Be inclusive.** We welcome new perspectives and people of all backgrounds. We work hard to be welcoming and supportive of anyone joining our community.
- **Be patient and constructive.** We understand that disagreements happen, but remind ourselves to assume good intentions and address mistakes constructively.
- **Focus on what is best.** We recognize that sometimes mistakes happen, and when they do, we appreciate when people own up to them. When we find problems, we focus on fixing them effectively and moving forward together.

The following behaviors are unacceptable and will not be tolerated:

- Harassment or intimidation of any kind
