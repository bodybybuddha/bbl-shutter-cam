# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are applied to the latest release on `main`. If you are on an older version, please upgrade to the latest release first.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please **do not** open a public GitHub Issue for potential security vulnerabilities.

Instead, report privately using one of these options:

- GitHub: use the repository's **Security → Advisories → Report a vulnerability** flow (preferred)
- If GitHub private reporting is not available for your account, contact the maintainer via the contact method listed in the project README.

Include:
- A clear description of the issue and impact
- Steps to reproduce (PoC if available)
- Affected versions / environments
- Any suggested fix or mitigation

## Disclosure

We will acknowledge receipt, investigate, and coordinate a fix/release. Please allow a reasonable time window for remediation before public disclosure.
